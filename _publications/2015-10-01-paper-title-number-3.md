excerpt: 'We study the ionized gas kinematics of 293 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts as compared to that of 485 control galaxies from the MaNGA–SDSS survey using measurements of the [O iii]5007 Å emission-line profiles, presenting flux, velocity, and W maps. In 45 per cent of the AGN, a broad component was needed to fit the line profiles wings within the inner few kpc, that we have identified with an outflow. But in most AGN, the profiles are broader than that of their controls over a much more extended region, identified as the ‘kinematically disturbed regions’ (KDRs). We find a positive correlation between the mean W and L[O iii], supporting that the KDR is due to heating and turbulence of the ISM by outflows and radiation from the AGN. The extent R reaches up to 24 kpc, with a mean ratio to that of the ENLR of 57 per cent. We estimate ionized gas mass flow rates (⁠⁠) and kinetic powers (⁠⁠) both from the AGN broad components and from the W values, that can be obtained for the whole AGN sample. We find values for and that correlate with the AGN luminosity ⁠, populating the low-luminosity end of these known correlations. The mean coupling efficiency between and AGN luminosity is 0.02 per cent from the W values and lower from the broad component. But the large extent of the KDR shows that even low-luminosity AGN can impact the host galaxy along several kpc in a “maintenance mode” feedback.'
